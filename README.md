This repository is the proposed solution to https://research.ibm.com/blog/quantum-open-science-prize. The main explanation is given in 'main_submission.ipynb'.

'time_evolution.ipynb' is a supplemetary notebook which implemets the time evolution of the solution.

In 'time_evolution_plots.pdf' we show the plots of the time evolution from 0 to pi and the differences of the two proposed techniques.
