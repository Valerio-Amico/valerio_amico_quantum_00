    "Our main goal is to find the operator $U_{best}$ for which the number of gates is minimum and for which holds (at all times):\n",

    "This can be intended in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $U_{best} = T$ (equality between operators)\n",
    "* $U_{best} \\neq T$, but the two different operators applied to the same vector yield the same result\n",
    "\n",
    "We followed both approaches, the former will be called *Hilbert Space Decomposition* (HSD) while for the latter we chose the name of *Single State Decomposition* (SSD).\n",
    "\n",
    "For HSD the best circuit we found is composed of 11 cnots (14 for the Jakarta geometry) while for the SSD approach we reached an even better 4 cnots solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, referring to qiskit's measurement error mitigation strategy (*https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-quantum-hardware/measurement-error-mitigation.html*), we tried to model also the noise introduced by the circuit instead of narrowing down to measurement error only."
